Submitted by: Aranjinsuren Enkhbat

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
  
  [As I have never worked with HTML, JS, or CSS before, I have looked at the documentations to understand the languages more.
   A simple example of this would be for loops, constants, and variable initialization in JS. e.g: int i -> let i; var, const; etc.
   I have also looked up piano notes frequencies on Wikipedia.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   [Firstly, time was the biggest issue I had. I was informed of the program and the opportunity by my friend on the 22nd of April afternoon (the day of the deadline).
   As I mentioned above, as I had never worked with HTML, JS, or CSS before, I thought it would be impossible to finish within a day, but I still decided to give it a shot and see how it goes.
   When I was just starting, I did not think I would be able to add more features such as the computer picking different patterns or allowing users to make 3 mistakes, considering the time constraint,
   but as I worked more on the js file, I began to think of many different ways that could improve the project (will discuss more on the 4th question) and wanted to challenge myself
   more by implementing some of the optional features as much as I possibly could before the deadline. I am satisfied with the outcome considering the time constraint I have had.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   [I am particularly interested in how web developers, as a team, make decisions of the design of the website.
   Obviously websites will have different designs and functionalities according to who will be using it and what it will be used for. How do you conduct the user research and make the decision of the design and features as a team?
   As a follow-up question, from the little things such as text fonts to complicated features, when there are conflicting ideas and suggestions, how does a team decide which one to implement?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  
  [Firstly, I would definitely try to read more into the other optional features that I was unable to implement such as limiting the amount of time for an user to enter their guess on each turn.
   Outside of the features suggested, here are some of the ideas that come to my mind:

1) Asking the user how many rounds of sequences they would like to play. Currently, my code is currently restricted to strict 7 sequences by using a for loop.
   I would most definitely implement a feature of asking the user to input how many rounds they would like to play.
2) Asking the user how many buttons they would like to play with.
   Currently, my project is limited to 5 buttons. If I had more time to spend on the project, I would definitely implement a feature to ask the user how many buttons they would like to play with.
3) Adding a counter of how many chances the user has left.
   Currently, although the user has three strikes, the website does not display the chances the user has remaining.
4) Different default difficulty modes.
   Easier difficulty mode would not speed up after each turn and have fewer buttons as a default.
   Harder difficulty mode would speed up after each turn and have more buttons as a default.
5) Making the project look more aesthetically pleasing.
   As of now, I have bare minimum knowledge of web development as I have only taken Python and Java courses.
   As I spend more time learning the languages, I would most definitely make the website look more aesthetically pleasing.]
